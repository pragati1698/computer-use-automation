# Architecture

One Python process owns one browser session. Discovery, replay, policy, perception/action, evidence and handoff are separate modules. A standard-library local HTTP app supplies a nontrivial search → detail → savings flow with fictional data. It uses nested tables and no test IDs, but retains accessible control names. This is intentionally a legacy-style web proxy, not proof of screenshot-only or desktop competence.

Discovery asks a live model for one typed decision per observation. The surface returns a minimized control inventory and recognized headings. Actions pass the same policy used by replay. Only verified execution enters the recorder. The agent can choose actions, repeat them, stop, or declare itself stuck; it is not a scripted fixture. The prompt and app-specific observation profile narrow the supported domain substantially. An independent final checkpoint plus typed extraction verifies completion. A separate replay module has no model dependency. Python and Playwright keep the vertical slice small and directly testable.

# Artifact schema

The Pydantic contract rejects unknown fields and unsupported versions. It contains schema and artifact versions, app family/version, provenance, typed input bindings, ordered actions with semantic targets and checkpoints, typed output specifications, a success heading and business-outcome mappings. The input type `member_id` is a five-ASCII-digit string; money uses a decimal string rather than binary float. A public JSON Schema accompanies the sample.

Input values never enter the artifact: type actions refer to a named parameter. The recorder serializes validated executed steps, not raw model transcripts. Output targets and application policy are app-profile decisions rather than inferred secrets. The fixture is explicitly labeled; a live artifact is emitted only after model-driven completion. Locators use exact accessible labels or role/name pairs, resolve uniquely and fail on ambiguity. There is deliberately no silent coordinate/CSS fallback that might select the wrong account. The schema is reviewable but not cryptographically signed or approval-gated.

# Determinism & error handling

Replay validates inputs and the complete action policy before execution. It follows recorded actions, uses bounded browser waits, checks each resulting state and extracts declared outputs only after the final success condition. It has no LLM recovery. Determinism means a fixed decision policy, not identical results when the application data changes.

Member-not-found and validation errors are business outcomes. Loading receives a bounded wait with recovery evidence; actions are never blindly reissued. Session locks and permission denials request intervention. Unknown states, ambiguous targets, blocked destinations and invalid outputs stop safely with sanitized state evidence. Result statuses are success, business_outcome, paused and failure; recoveries are intermediate events. Checkpoint intervention can resume the current workflow. Execution exceptions remain failures even after inspection because whether an action partially completed may be uncertain. Resume never automatically retries a possibly applied operation.

# Heterogeneity & multi-tenant

The Surface protocol separates observation, targeting, action and extraction from the flow contract. This implementation still has browser-specific waiting/session mechanics; extracting those into a scheduler/session interface is necessary before a second adapter. A desktop adapter would map semantic targets to accessibility controls or reviewed visual anchors, implement its own state checks, and preserve the same typed inputs/results. It cannot merely reuse DOM selectors.

For tenant reuse, use an immutable vendor-flow version plus reviewed tenant profiles for origins, supported app versions, scoped target bindings and known state signatures. Resolve profiles before execution; tenant configuration must not widen policy. Validate compatibility and unique targets at startup and checkpoints, then stop on drift. Record the base artifact hash and profile revision per invocation. This project implements the fixed demo compatibility marker only; tenant overrides and distributed execution are design proposals, not implemented features.

# Escalation & handoff

The controller transitions automation → paused → human → verified automation. Intervention evidence contains capability, step, expected checkpoint, structural state and reason. The CLI is a minimal local routing surface: the physically present operator uses the same headed browser and signals resume. The browser event loop continues to pump while terminal input waits on another thread. UI event types and navigation occurrence are recorded without values; these are a minimal audit, not a replayable recording of arbitrary human edits. Only one owner can issue automation actions. Navigation guardrails stay installed during takeover.

After resume, the expected checkpoint must be visible before automation regains control. No manual actions are silently promoted into the reusable capability. Timeout, abort or failed verification preserves paused ownership until the CLI tears down the session. There is no durable remote operator queue or cross-process resume. Automated tests exercise the live seam with a simulated operator; genuine operator use is documented separately.

# Safety

A code-owned read-only policy permits a configured local origin, three routes, GET requests, member-ID entry, Search and Savings operations. Model output and saved artifacts cannot grant new permissions. All other operations, including account creation, are blocked. Browser request interception checks destinations, including redirect requests; service workers are disabled. This is a constrained demo guardrail, not an OS sandbox against malicious application code or an adversarial local operator.

Observation and persistent evidence use allowlisted structural labels instead of raw DOM, screenshots, query strings, exception messages, input values or balances. The richer failure signal is a sanitized control/state snapshot. Model rationale is a short enumerated action reason, not private reasoning. Output values go to the caller in memory/stdout. Goals are transmitted to the configured model, so callers must keep sensitive data out of goals. Production requires authenticated operators, approved model/data processing, stronger outbound isolation, comprehensive audit controls and retention policy. None are claimed here.

# Cuts

The focused read-only capability covers the complete implemented execution seam without risky write semantics. No account creation, arbitrary app discovery, visual matching, tenant runtime, capability catalog, artifact signing, distributed queues or polished operator console. Explicit bounded waits replace broad retries. The model/provider and browser integration must be verified in the user's environment; genuine discovery evidence cannot be substituted by fixture replay. Next priorities are completing live discovery evidence, richer sanitized human-action targets, an adapter-neutral scheduler, and independent tenant compatibility tests. Add writes only with operation-specific approvals and duplicate-effect protection.
